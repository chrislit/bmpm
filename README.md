Beider-Morse Phonetic Matching Algorithm

The purpose of this repository is simply to track changes in the reference (PHP) implementation of
the [Beider-Morse Phonetic Matching Algorithm](http://stevemorse.org/phoneticinfo.htm) to aid
in my Python port (available as part of [Abydos](https://github.com/chrislit/abydos)).
