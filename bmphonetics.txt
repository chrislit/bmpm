2. Batch encoding of all names in database

   Note: If you have generated your PHP search engine using the one-step
   search application generator, you encode the names in your database
   using the intructions in question 410 on the FAQ page.  The instructions
   in this section do not apply to you.
   
   Use a modified version of batchSample.php.  That script has very specific input/output
   file format, and you will probably want to modify the script to accomodate your
   particular format.
   
   The invocaton of this script is as follows:
   
      batch.php?inputFileName=XXX&outputFileName=yyy

   Each line of input File XXX is of the format

      name
      name
      ...
      name

   Each line of output file YYY is of the format

      name\tBMCODE\tDMCODE

3. Code to be added to your PHP search engine

    The easiest approach is to place the phonetic routines (phoneticengine.php
    and phoneticutils.php) in the same folder as your search engine.
    Alternatively, you can place the phonetic routines in some other folder
    of your choice.  In either case, the gen, ash, and sep directories
    are to be subfolders of the folder in which you place the phonetic
    routines.

    If you have generated your PHP search engine using the one-step
    search-application generator, you don't need to add any special code
    to your search engine.  However, if you've chosen not to place
    the phonetic routines in the same folder as your search engine, you will
    need to tell the search engine where they are.  You do that by modifying
    the $folder variable in your search engine accordingly.
     
    If you have written your PHP search engine from scratch, then you will need to
    include the code below into it at an appropriate place.  This code assumes
    the you have placed the phonetic routines in the same folder as your search
    engine.  If you've placed them somewhere else, you will have to modify the
    paths in the include statements accordingly.


    // encode name using BM phonetic code
    // assume name to be encoded is in $name, can be in utf-8 or in html-ampersand notation

    require_once "phoneticutils.php";
    require_once "phoneticengine.php";
    require_once "gen/lang.php";
    require_once "gen/approxcommon.php";
    for ($i=0; $i<count($languages); $i++) {
      require_once "gen/rules" . $languages[$i] . ".php";
      require_once "gen/approx" . $languages[$i] . ".php";
    }
    $lang = Language($name, $languageRules);
    $codes =
      PhoneticNumbers(
        Phonetic($name,
                 $rules[LanguageIndexFromCode($lang, $languages)],
                 $approxCommon,
                 $approx[LanguageIndexFromCode($lang, $languages)],
                 $lang));

    // encode name using DM soundex code, assume name to be encoded is in $name
  
    require_once "dmsoundex.php";
    $codes = soundx_name($name);

4. Sephardic and Ashkenazic Jewish Names

   A certain amount of optimization can be done if it is known a priori that the names
   involved are sephardic or Ashkenazic names.  In that case add "type=ash" or "type=sep"
   to the invocation lines of batch.php as well as your php search engine.  That is,
   invoke batch.php as follows for ashkenazic names:
   
      batch.php?inputFileName=XXX&outputFileName=yyy&type=ash

   Also, if you have generated your PHP search engine using the one-step
   search-application generator, you need to change $langtype="gen" to either
   $langtype="ash" or $langtype="sep".
